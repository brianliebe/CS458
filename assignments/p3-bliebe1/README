Bingsuns:	No, Bingsuns didn't have OpenSSL which was required
		to get this to work. I ran everything on an Ubuntu machine,
		and it works using the public IP of the laptop/PC and a random
		port (I used 9943).
How To:		1. make
		2. ./sslserv <port>
		3. ./sslcli <ip> <port>
		4. ./gen-pass
Notes:		When I tested this, I used my public IP address, but I also
		tried with localhost (127.0.0.1) and this works as well.
