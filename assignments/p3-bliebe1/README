Bingsuns:	No, Bingsuns didn't have an updated OpenSSL which was required
		to get this to work (sudo apt install libssl-dev). I put more info
		about this in 'Notes'. I can come demo this if you can't get it to
		work, it works on my laptop 100%.

How To:		1. make
		2. ./sslserv <port>
		3. ./sslcli <ip> <port>
		4. ./gen-pass

Notes:		Bingsuns was missing libssl-dev which I needed to get the SSL server
		to run correctly. I got this to work on my labtop and PC (Ubuntu) by
		using localhost (127.0.0.1). I also got it to work on my laptop while
		on campus Wifi using my public IP address, but couldn't get it to work
		at my apartment using my public IP (I think this is because of my apartment's
		weird Wifi). I emailed the professor and she said this was fine, and 
		that I can demo it if you could not get it to work, but it should always
		work using 127.0.0.1 on a personal machine.
		Also, I DID try using the "setenv" stuff that the professor suggested to
		get this working and it did not change anything, unfortunately.
