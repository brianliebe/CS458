Language:	C++

Platform:	Linux

How To:		1. make
		2. ./vf <port number>
		3. ./voter-cli <IP address> <port>

Encryption:	See "shared.h" -> 'string encrypt(Key, string)' and also 'struct cryptor'

Decryption:	See "shared.h" -> 'string decrypt(Key, string)' and also 'struct cryptor'

Notes:		Due to SSL restrictions, this is not working on Bingsuns. It will
		work using 127.0.0.1 on a linux machine, and it will also work if 
		you're on BU wifi and use your public IP address (from testing).
		The public/private keys are saved within 'shared.h' in the public_key
		and private_key functions.

		NOTE: I did this with SSL because the code worked well from project
		3 and I didn't want to re-write it. However, I DID still do the
		encryption using RSA, so it's kind of "double" encrypted I suppose.
		I asked the professor and she said this is fine.
